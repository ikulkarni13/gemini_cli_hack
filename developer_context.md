# This is what were building

VisionBoard CLI turns your hard drive into a mirror of who you’re becoming: a local-first AI that scans the folders you choose (PDFs, notes, code, images) and instantly builds a living vision board grounded in your actual work—clear themes with evidence tags, future identities with a why, short present-tense affirmations, and tiny action prompts you can do today. It’s evidence-based motivation rather than wishful thinking: show a messy folder, run one command, open a clean HTML board (plus a slick terminal view), and see your path—Quant, Engineer, Musician—snap into focus. Everything stays on your machine. Your files. Your future. Visualized.

# These are the hackathon instructions
AI Tinkerers × Google — Gemini CLI Buildathon
Theme: Creative, Personal & Local

Format: 4‑hour in‑person Buildathon — fast, focused, ship‑something energy.

Focus: Show what’s possible when Gemini CLI talks directly to your local environment — files, data, scripts, sensors, shell tools. No production deploy required.

🔍 About the Buildathon
Re‑imagine the command line as your personal AI studio. In a fast 4‑hour sprint, teams will prototype headless AI agents and workflows that call the Google Gemini CLI / API to do useful, locally grounded things.

See the Gemini CLI github here

Why local? Because the most valuable AI often starts close to home—where your notes, data, and daily tools already live. Think:

Research Wrangler: Sweep a downloads folder full of PDFs, auto‑extract key findings, build structured notes.
Story Forge: Generate a custom bedtime story plus image assets saved to disk and ready to AirDrop to a tablet.
Writing Stitcher: Feed a plain‑English outline + scattered markdown notes; have Gemini assemble a cohesive short story.
CLI Lab Assistant: Natural‑language wrapper around shell commands that can search, transform, and summarize project files.
Data‑Aware Agents: Use local CSVs, logs, or config files to personalize outputs, alerts, or dashboards.
Bring whatever local data you’re comfortable using. Synthetic / sample data is fine.

🏆 Judging Criteria (100 pts)
Projects are scored across four weighted dimensions. Judges will use a shared rubric; ties break on Impact.

Weight	Category	What We’re Looking For
20%	Technical Excellence	Robust, working code; reliability; ability to demo end‑to‑end.
20%	Solution Architecture & Documentation	Clear structure, maintainable repo, install/setup steps, README clarity, inline docs that make it reproducible & extensible.
30%	Gemini Integration	Depth + creativity of Gemini usage (multimodal? tool calling? chaining? prompts? eval loops?). Effective API use over hype.
30%	Impact & Innovation	Does it solve a meaningful problem? Unlock a new pattern? Show a powerful personal/local workflow others could adopt?
Tip: Production deployment is not required. Focus on a compelling prototype that clearly shows how Gemini CLI enables the use case.
